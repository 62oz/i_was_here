    Project Setup:
        Set up your development environment with Go and Fyne.
        Decide on a project structure that separates your application logic, UI, and database-related code.

    User Authentication and Account Creation:
        Implement a user registration and login system.
        Use a secure authentication mechanism (e.g., OAuth2) for user login.

    User Profiles:
        Allow users to create and edit their profiles.
        Implement profile pictures and basic user information.

    Photo Upload and Geolocation:
        Integrate the ability to upload photos from the user's device.
        Utilize geolocation services (e.g., GPS) to capture and store the location where a photo was taken.

    Post Visibility and Privacy:
        Implement post visibility settings (public, friends-only, private).
        Define and enforce rules for who can see each post based on its geolocation and privacy settings.

    Posts, Likes, Comments:
        Create a system for users to post photos.
        Implement the ability to like and comment on posts.
        Store and manage post-related data in your database.

    Database Integration:
        Choose a database (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite) to store user data, posts, likes, and comments.
        Design the database schema to efficiently store and retrieve the required information.

    API Development:
        Create a RESTful API to handle various app functions (e.g., user registration, login, post creation, post deletion, liking, commenting).
        Define API endpoints and request/response structures.

    UI Design and Development:
        Design a user-friendly and visually appealing UI using the Fyne framework.
        Implement different screens for account creation, login, user profiles, photo uploads, posts, and interactions.

    Security and Privacy:
        Implement security measures to protect user data and authentication credentials.
        Ensure that private user information and photos are appropriately secured.

    Testing:
        Write unit tests and integration tests to verify the functionality of your app.
        Test different scenarios, including edge cases and error handling.

    Deployment:
        Choose a hosting solution for your backend API and database.
        Deploy your app to a server or cloud platform.
        Prepare your app for release on different platforms (e.g., Windows, macOS, Linux).

    Scaling and Performance:
        Consider strategies for scaling your app as the user base grows.
        Optimize database queries and app performance.
